# NeurIPS 2021 BEETL Competition - Benchmarks for EEG Transfer Learning
This is the NeurIPS BEETL repository

## Competition information

Details about the competition are available on the official website: https://beetl.ai/

We offer two specific challenges to promote the development of EEG decoding to use big data:

* Task 1 is a cross-subject sleep stage decoding challenge reflecting the need for transfer learning in clinical diagnostics. This challenge aims to compare and give a benchmark of transfer learning algorithms in the literature.
* Task 2 is a cross-dataset motor imagery decoding challenge reflecting the need for transfer learning in human interfacing. This challenge aims to promote new algorithms that can utilise EEG data across data sets or data centers.
